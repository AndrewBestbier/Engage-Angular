# Engage
Engage is a backchannel that allows students to ask questions in lectures both anonymously and in real time. These questions are then projected onto a screen infront of the class. This system reduces student passivity and Engages students in new ways.

This is my first open source project so please share your experience with me! I plan on getting Engage into thousands of student's hands this year. Let's improve the education system together.

Plan outline:

Engage Android app - Native
IOs app - Built with Ionic
Web app - AngularJs and Firebase
