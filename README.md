**Innovation**:
 * Lecturers can ask the students questions back. These are shown to students in a secondary panel. They can vote and the results are shown instantly in a graph. Perhaps use Google Graphs plugin for this guy. Perhaps make this in its own branch
 * Build the Android and IOS application using IONIC and firebase.
