**Introduction:**

Engage is a backchannel that allows students to ask questions in lectures both anonymously and in real time. These questions are then projected onto a screen infront of the class. This system reduces student passivity and Engages students in new ways.

This is my first open source project so please share your experience with me! I plan on getting Engage into thousands of student's hands this year. Let's improve the education system together.

For this project I am using Google's Material Design and Firebase.

**Broad vision:**

 * Develope a native Android Application for Engage
 * Develop an IOS application using Ionic
 * Develop a web application using AngularJs and Firebase
 
**Todo List**:

 * Upload and finish landing page with Material Design theme. I am  considering using [this as a basis](http://joashpereira.com/templates/material_one_pager/). 
 * Add a shuffling animation when the questions are sorted.
 * Add a switch where users can sort questions by how recent they are or how popular they are.
 * Add a vote icon (up arrow) that changes colour when you have voted on that question
 * Use cookies to ensure users vote on a question only once
